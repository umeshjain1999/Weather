### How I created this project
- All-weather information are fetched using Weather API. 
- I have used useState and useEffect to manage the data across the components in Reactjs.
- The suggestion of the city in the search bar is fetched from API and Highlighting specific words is done by a [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-highlight-words).
- To get current location of the user <br>
```
  if ("geolocation" in navigator) {
            // check if geolocation is supported/enabled on current browser
            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
            function success(position) {
              // for when getting location is a success
              setLocation({latitude :  position.coords.latitude , longitude :  position.coords.longitude});
              setLoading(false);
           },
            function error(error_message) {
              // for when getting location results in an error
              console.error('An error has occured while retrieving location', error_message);
                    
            }  
          );

} 
  
  else {
    // geolocation is not supported
    // get your location some other way
    console.log('geolocation is not enabled on this browser')
    alert('Give access to your location');
    setLoading(false)
  }
```
